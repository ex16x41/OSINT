>> Index Forums 

# Forums / platforms search engines 

# Google Dorks method 
to monitor latest posts on forums that are indexed by specific search engines, 
we need to understand how they are structured 
in a forum or a blog / or other platform we can often see specific strings within the URL such as tid | threat | topic | blog | viewtopic and others. 

So what we do is, use this with google hacking in the following format 
~~~
inurl:tid | thread | topic | viewtopic | blog intext:leaked + db 
~~~
or any other intext \ topic you're interested in finding most recet mentions or posts of 
* Set the time frame to last hour or 24 hours - depends on what you need 
* Some results will be FP, as can be expected. but most will relate to different forums speaking about 
keywords such as leaked + db = indicated leaked database
* If you use more than 2 keywords, chances are to get less false positives. 
* Use any language = monitor russian / chinese posts/ forums based on keywords and their associations 
* Use different search engines = different results, different sources indexed / archived
